# Facial Expression Recognition DCNN
This is the first DL project that I'm publishing. It is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network that I trained to recognize facial expressions using TensorFlow and [this](https://www.kaggle.com/sulthankhan/facial-expression-recognition) dataset. The DCNN is implemented using a python OpenCV script that detects daces using a HaarCascade and then feeds the faces into the model.
